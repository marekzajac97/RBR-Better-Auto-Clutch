Simple RBR plugin for poor folks like me with no clutch pedal. Engages and releases the clutch pedal below a certain (configurable) RMP threshold. This allows for preventing stalling the engine as well as starting from 1st gear making it a bit more useful than the vanilla auto-clutch. IMPORTANT: for this to work, be sure to disable "Clutch Help" from the "Gear" settings. Credits to creators of RBR H-Shifter and NGPCarMenu plugins for reversed structs and offsets.
